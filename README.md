## Description: 
A simple text editing application that developers can use to creat pseudo code

## Installation: 
Click the Install Now button located in the upper left hand corner of the navigation bar or click the install icon in the far right side of your browser's search bar to install the application to your web browser.

## Usage: 
The text Editor can be used to write any letter, number, or special character you would like to use in creating a program, writing an essay-not recommended-or even spelling out a recipe. The main purpose is to pseudo code, as there aren't any formatting helpers offered by other text editors such as vs code.
